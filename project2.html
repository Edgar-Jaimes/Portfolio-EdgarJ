    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>
      This project highlights my first Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition, which is a cybersecurity event
      where participants earn points by completing a variety of security challenges. The goal is to solve
      tasks as efficiently as possible and apply different cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on way.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the competition, I worked through challenges focused on threat analysis, password cracking,
      and vulnerability exploitation. I used Kali Linux as my main environment to run tools,
      test solutions, and validate results. Each challenge required careful attention to detail and a step-by-step
      problem-solving approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      I collaborated with teammates under time constraints, which pushed me to communicate clearly, divide tasks,
      and stay organized. This competition helped me improve how I approach technical problems when there is
      limited time and multiple challenges happening at once.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      This CTF was my first competition experience and gave me a strong foundation in hands-on cybersecurity work.
      It strengthened my confidence with tools like Kali Linux and improved my ability to solve technical challenges
      quickly while collaborating with a team.
