    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>
      The Horse Plinko Cyber Challenge (HPCC) is a competitive cybersecurity event designed to
      simulate real-world defensive security operations. I participated as a member of the
      Blue Team, where the primary objective was to protect Windows and Linux
      servers from ongoing, live attacks launched by a Red Team.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the competition, my team was responsible for maintaining system availability while
      actively monitoring for suspicious activity and responding to security incidents in real time.
      This required balancing multiple priorities at once, such as identifying threats, applying
      defensive changes, and ensuring that critical services remained operational despite constant
      attack attempts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I actively contributed to system defense by monitoring network traffic and system behavior,
      investigating potential compromises, and helping implement mitigation strategies. The
      competition environment closely mirrored real incident-response scenarios, where quick
      decision-making, communication, and technical awareness are essential to minimizing downtime
      and impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the event, my team successfully coordinated defensive efforts under pressure and
      maintained over 80% server uptime, demonstrating effective incident response
      and teamwork in a high-stress environment.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      This competition strengthened my understanding of defensive cybersecurity concepts and
      reinforced the importance of teamwork, communication, and adaptability during active security
      incidents. The experience provided a realistic look into Blue Team responsibilities and helped
      me build confidence in responding to threats while maintaining system availability.
